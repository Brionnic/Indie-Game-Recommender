      "             If you would check my games here on steam you would notice that farming games like Stardew Valley aren't that type of games I normally play. In my opinion in the most farming games you are bored after maybe an hour or two. But in fact- Stardew Valley isn't boring! Not at all! But let's start at the beginning.\n",
      "             <br/>\n",
      "             When I started to play this game for an hour or a lil bit more I got really bored to be honest. My big problem was that I didn't know how this game works. I didn't know how to fishing, farming- or better say I didnt know how I had to organize my farm that all would work. And it's annoying so you don't want to play it longer. So I would add only one thing to that game:\n",
      "             <i>\n",
      "              a tutorial\n",
      "             </i>\n",
      "             . It would be really helpful so that you know what your first steps should be. But of course.. I have to say there are some guides who can help you a little bit too, but I think it's better the game would explain and show you all. ;)\n",
      "             <br/>\n",
      "             And after I learned about the important things in Stardew  I had really fun to create my own farm. The big different between Stardew Valley and other farming games is that you can do lots of other things than only to be on your farm. For example: You can do mining. You have in this game your \"own mine\". And its really cool in there because there are a lot of floors. ( It feels a little bit like in the old Pokékom games :D) And every floor is getting harder then of course.. in that mine are monster you have to fight ;). Fishing makes very fun too. Something that I really like too is that you can interact with lots of NPC's. You can fall in love with one of them and get married.. and have your own family or maybe you are so unfriendly that noone notice you and you will be forever alone.. it'S your desicion :P. But yeah really- it's so cool that you can get really good friends wih them and every day whe you talk to them they say differents things etc., its really awesome!\n",
      "             <br/>\n",
      "             I could say a lot of other good things about that game like that you have a libary where you can donate artifacts you find in that game and get cool stuff for your farm. Or that you have differet festivals per year etc.\n",
      "             <br/>\n",
      "             So what I really want to say is: Even you don't like farming games (like me either) you should really try that game! You will probably love it after a few hours like me! ^^\n",
