      "{'rating': 0, 'review': 'I have tried playing this game before when it first came out and I didn\\'t understand it; so I really disliked it. Now that 1.1 has come out I decided to give it another go, about 50 hours later I have mixed feeling and really wish I didn\\'t. <br><br>For a game made by a single person (or a small group of people) it is inspiring. It is well made and shows that this is a project crafted in love. That said, it has this feeling of a void that cannot be filled. Something is missing from this game and I am not sure what that thing is. Is it the lack of end game progression or meaningful skills? Is it the constant grind? Or the push to be more efficient all the time? I am not sure.<br><br>Stardew Valley lands in this place of trying to tell a story without forcing it on the player. Which sounds great on paper, but it just falls short in my opinion. The connection to the towns people is superficial and my immersion to the game as this city-folk turned farmer broke as the game went further and further into the late game. The townspeople felt less like friendly faces I want to get to know and more like obstacles. I just disliked the people and the temptation to just get the Jojo Mart to demolish the community center became more and more appealing. <br><br>And after finding out what the \"ending\" is for the major storyline, I said to myself \"is that it?\" While the game can be played forever, the main story arch falls flat and I feel no meaningful connection to it. For the amount of effort and time put into the game, I just don\\'t personally feel a sense of accomplishment. Only one character in the game seems to achieve somethings and its not you, its some other character. This feeling is made even worse with the lack of a personal connection made to the towns people I really could care less. And even after 50 hours of putting into the title, I am going to stop playing the game for right now.<br><br>I would say I enjoyed the early game the most, the mystery of the game, but hated the story line, the connection to the townspeople and the late game grind and lack of meaningful skills or items. (I guess I answered my earlier question). I am going to rate this as a negative review solely because a mixed review gets lost in the sea of the overwhelmingly positive reviews.<br><br>In my opinion, I think this game is highly overrated, but that does not mean its a horrible game or a bad game. I think it has the potential to be a good game, but for right now I think its just an okay game. It has a great initial experience, but as the game progress it gets worse and worse. <br><br><br><br>', 'user': '76561198017599168'}\n",

      "{'rating': 0, 'review': '[This is a constructive criticism review, where perceived problems are identified with solutions to them provided. This review is based on the current game mechanics and may flip positive at a later date, it would be \\'Neutral\\' if such an option were available. Ignore my low playtime, I mainly play offline which isn\\'t recorded. The review gets cut off, the full review is here: <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://pastebin.com/TfzHrqYJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://pastebin.com/TfzHrqYJ</a>]<br><br>Stardew Valley is a game that\\'s good with beginnings, which is why it seems so amazing when you first begin playing it. But after investing a good many hours into playing with it\\'s beginning, I\\'ve noticed it struggles with something extremely important: <b>Endgame</b>. For many of the skills, there isn\\'t one. It\\'s the same problem Sim City had, it seemed to have so much potential in the beginning but didn\\'t appear to have any deeper territory to explore. This leaves Stardew Valley as a very shallow experience in it\\'s current state, in my opinion, but the developer has stated they\\'re open to expanding in the future.<br><br><b>Fishing</b>: Fishing has a steady increase in difficulty throughout the game, with common fish becoming easier to catch, while endgame fish become actually obtainable with skill, planning and patience.<br><br><i>What\\'s The Problem?</i>: There are several legendary fish in the game you can use to truly test out your fishing skill, which makes Fishing one of the more fleshed out professions. Once you catch them, that\\'s it. They can never be caught again, not even after a year has passed. Your skill with fishing can never be challenged again, you\\'re stuck fishing significantly easier things, with no endgame left.<br><br><b>Combat</b>: Combat is one of the more disappointing endgame skills, because it is so tightly tied in with Mining, which has a similar poor endgame. While there are several weapon types available, each with their own sort of \\'skill\\', chances are you will never use them.<br><br><i>What\\'s The Problem?</i>: Combat has the MOST problems. Many of the types of monsters you find you will see only fleetingly in your path through the mines. Unless you return to grind them for many days, even though they pose no threat to you. Grinding ridiculous numbers of enemies appears to be the endgame of combat to get rewards from Gil in the Adventurer\\'s Guild. Worse, none of the enemies in the \\'final dungeon\\' have kill counts, ensuring that your carving through all those enemies are not tallying up to anything. This could be solved by having pumped-up versions of older enemies populate the final dungeon so you won\\'t have to go back and grind on easy enemies. Or it could be solved by letting you bait progressively stronger monsters into a monster cave or pit on your farm to kill each day, ensuring you can put combat to use somewhere that isn\\'t mining-related.<br><br>There is the possibility of encountering \\'Elite\\' monsters in the mines, but they are so rare I can recall encountering precisely three of them in my entire first year. Two were in the Stardew Mines, one in the Desert Mines. These are more powerful enemies meant to drop good items. The ones in the Mines dropped a Magnet Ring and a Glow Ring, simple items that you can get from smashing crates. The one deep in the Desert Mine dropped a level 3 Lead Rod. In fact, the vast majority of loot drops have been Magnet Rings, Glow Rings or Lead Rods in both the bottom of the Stardew Mine and the Desert Mine. The game contains absolutely no endgame loot from monsters to speak of, nor any rare endgame drops to acquire from them. No amazing gear, no blueprints, no enemy has a unique drop native to them. There\\'s not even a bestiary menu in game to see how many of each enemy you\\'ve killed, or what loot you\\'ve gathered from each enemy, as many games have.<br><br>You have three weapon types. Dagger, Club and Sword. They all have their own skills, which don\\'t matter because you won\\'t using any of them, but more on that later. There are no endgame Daggers or Clubs, only Swords. The second to best sword you can buy from the Adventurer\\'s Guild for 25,000 gold, which is far better than the Club or Dagger. The only legendary weapon in the game is also a sword, so you can either run the Desert Mines with objectively far weaker weapon types or you can run with a sword. Why is the \\'legendary weapon\\' always a sword in games at the expense of other weapons, I wonder?<br><br>On the matter of weapon skills, the Dagger has a rapid 3-hit, the Club can pound and knock enemies away, and the Sword can shield to deflect oncoming enemy attacks. You will never use any of these because there are no enemies that warrant using them. Combat is resolved by rapidly clicking attack as fast as you can to stunlock an enemy, or prevent them from getting too close to you. There is no strategy involved, beyond the digger monster who forces you to reposition yourself constantly to strike it down. The digger monster shows up only in the very early section of the mines, however. Perhaps combat could have been more fleshed out if you learned more skills as the game went on.<br><br>If you think perhaps you can sneak around the mines to avoid combat, the game prevents that. Every so often you will hear the screech of a flying enemy from nowhere, spawned in to home in on your location. You will constantly be stopping to kill these flying enemies, which I assume are a failsafe to ensure a ladder can appear when they die on the rare chance that one doesn\\'t from the rocks you mine.<br><br>On the subject of the Desert Mines, they are effectively endless. But after spending the entirety of Winter in them, I have been able to tell several things: There is no reward for getting further than Floor 25. No new enemies spawn in. Enemies don\\'t get an increased chance of spawning as elite, meaning the difficulty remains the same. There doesn\\'t appear to be a significantly increased chance of gems whether you\\'re on floor 1 or 100. After spending countless hours in them, I\\'ve only see 3 Iridium Ore Veins (which weren\\'t particularly deep in) and nothing that can drop a Prismatic Shard, the rarest item in the game. I obtained my Prismatic Shard from the unlocked quarry. There is no depth to the mines, what you can mine in them or the enemies you can fight in them.<br><br>Combat (and mining) is perhaps the profession that will most cause your relationships around town to suffer, for 5,000 - 10,000 gold per day in the endgame. Which requires more time than endgame farming for less endgame gold. With all other professions you are more or less around town, able to chat with villagers when you see them wander by your area. A dedicated miner who wants any decent earnings per day will leave Stardew at 9 AM and returning at midnight. With Friendship Decay as a mechanic in the game, this is a significant downside to the Desert Mine.<br><br>On the matter of equipment, the best shoes in the game are not something you can get as a rare drop, because as stated no enemies have rare drops. You get them for reaching Floor 110 in the Stardew Mines. There\\'s nothing better beyond that. No boots give anything beyond a bonus to defense or debuff immunity. There is at least an endgame ring you can craft, giving a boost to many things.<br><br>Combat has a LOT of problems, the worst of which is you can\\'t make a profit purely off of combat because there are no endgame monsters with expensive drops to test your skills against. 99% of your combat profit comes from what you mine. Enemy drops are worth very little. If there were a coloseum-type place in the game where you could fight monsters and survive for rewards, it might be more of a self-sustaining job.<br><br>[continued <a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://pastebin.com/TfzHrqYJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://pastebin.com/TfzHrqYJ</a>]', 'user': 'Wsprl'}\n",
